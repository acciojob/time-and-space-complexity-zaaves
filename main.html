	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is an important measure for determining how efficient an algorithm is, especially for large input sizes.</p>
    <p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required to solve an algorithm as a function of the input size. It is often denoted in terms of <b>Space Complexity</b> and analyzed using the Big-O notation, such as O(n).</p>
